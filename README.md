# XGBoost-Decision-tree-for-Predicting-Energy-consumption
In this project, we will create a classification model to predict energy consumptions of buildings(EUI-High/Low) using XGBoost and Decision tree . We aim to use XGBoost to further improve accuracy of the model.

**Libraries:**	    
  [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)                  
  [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)                  
  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)               
  
  
 **Programming Languages:**     
  Python
